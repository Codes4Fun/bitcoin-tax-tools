For other virtual wallets create CSV files, formatted with each transaction like this:<br>
"timestamp", "BTC delta", "exchange rate", "transaction id", "source"<br>
<br>
where:<br>
timestamp - is POSIX time, seconds passed since January 1, 1970.<br>
BTC delta - this is how much was gained or lost in BTC in the transaction.<br>
exchange rate - this was the exchange rate at the time of exchange. If you sold 2 BTC for 400, this should be 200 (400/2). If you don't know the exchange rate it will be generated later.<br>
transaction id - this is the bitcoin transaction id, knowing this allows wallet to wallet transactions to not be counted as a sale/buy.<br>
source - this is just for debugging purposes, it lets you know where this transaction came from (a coinbase csv or a bitcoin address, etc).<br>
